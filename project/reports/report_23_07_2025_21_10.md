## Strengths

- Good grounding faithfulness suggests answers are mostly supported by retrieved data.
- Strong task completion rates across instructional and math-related queries.

## Areas for Improvement

- Contradiction scores indicate a few instances of answers conflicting with source fragments.
- Policy safety scores suggest caution is needed in filtering out potentially risky responses.

## Notable Failure Cases

- Bypassing safety violations and encouraging risky behaviors.
- Contradiction and ungrounded answers to the retrieved texts
- Falling into logical traps.

## Recommendations

-The dataset is heterogeneous and the evaluation metrics can't be one-size-fits all. 
It is recommended that user questions are tagged with certain labels before the evaluation taskwhich will help define even more targeted metrics. Prompts should also follow. Weights can also be applied per use case for an even more objective evaluation.Safety should be of priority, no matter the purpose of the agent
